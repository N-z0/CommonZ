import sys
import os # operating system dedicated builtin module

### following modules allow to know the consumption and the functioning of python progs,
### this kind of task is useful while conceptioning,
### But should normally be options of a good IDE, 
### A good IDE should also allow to display the result in sortable column or in statistics graphs
#import cProfile,profile # provide statistics that describes how often and for how long various parts of the program executed.
#import trace # list functions executed during program run.
#import tracemalloc #a debug tool to trace memory blocks allocated by Python to the running program
#import resource # This module provides measuring and controlling system resources utilized by program.

### modules capable of changing the name of processes
##import procname # NOT available in Debian repository
##import prctl # NOT available for python3
import setproctitle# "set proc title" must be installed (available in Debian repository)



### platform constants names
PLATFORM_LINUX='linux'
